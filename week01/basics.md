## Week 1: Basics of Programming

1. Make a basic calculator which inputs two numbers and an operator and outputs the desired result. Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operation

    - Example Output
        ```
        Return first number :10
        Enter Operator: +
        Enter Second Number: 100
        10 + 100 = 110
        ```
    - Try to also add a prompt if the operator is not supported
        ```
        Return first number :1
        Enter Operator: a
        Wrong Operator, Try Again!!
        Enter Operator: b
        Wrong Operator, Try Again!!
        Enter Operator: -
        Enter Second Number: 2
        1 - 2 = -1
        ```
    - Try to implement power and factorial without using inbuilt functions. Make a different function for power and factorial and use them in the calculator

2. Input a number n. Print integers 1 to N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.
    - Example Output
        ```
        Enter a number: 10
        1
        2
        Fizz
        4
        Buzz
        Fizz
        7
        8
        Fizz
        Buzz
        ```

3. Implement the function `int sumOfDigits(int num){}` which will take `num` as input in return the sum of the digits as output.
    - Eg: input = 12345; output = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
